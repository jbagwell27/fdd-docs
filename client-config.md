title: Configuring the Mod
order: b
---
!!!danger If you really hate editing config files by hand, it's suggested that you use our [Config Editor App](https://github.com/hypherionmc/simple-rpc-editor/releases/). It includes Live preview and fetches the available images directly from discord!
!!!

||| Information
Simple RPC uses a TOML based config system with a very simple, well named and commented layout. When running the mod for the first time, a config file will be created using the default settings. You can use the mod as is, use your own data, or use a [Custom App](custom-app.md) entirely.
!!!primary
Since Simple RPC Version 1.4, it's possible to create a config for different languages. To learn more, Check out [Multi Language Config Files](#multi-language-config-files)
!!!

!!!danger
You do not need to restart the game while editing the config. The config will AUTO RELOAD when the file is saved
!!!

### Default Config

!!!warning
It has recently been discovered that discord has a character limitation on the imageText. It CANNOT be longer than 1288 chars and shorter than 2 chars
!!!

!!!info
You can also use Direct links to PNG images to use as "image keys". To do this, upload your image to a site like IMGUR, Dropbox or Github and right click the image, then copy URL. If you paste this URL into your browser and ONLY see the image, it will work. If you see a webpage, it will NOT work!
!!!

### Multi-Language Config Files [!badge Available since 1.4] 
||| Information
Simple RPC allows for language detection in Minecraft, so If you decide you wanna play Minecraft in a different language, your discord status can now be shown in that language. But it requires some setup, which is why this section exists.

When launching the game for the first time with 1.4 installed, you will find a new folder called `simple-rpc` inside your `.minecraft` folder. This is the folder in which you will place your translated config files.

To create a translated config file, copy `simple-rpc.toml` from your config folder to the `simple-rpc` folder. To make sure the mod loads the correct config file, you need to rename the file a bit. The new name of your file will now be `simple-rpc_lang_code.toml`.
!!!primary
To find a complete list of lang-codes, check out this site -> https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Languages.
!!!

Once you have created this file, you can change all "state", "description", "largeimagetext" and "smallimagetext" fields. You cannot translate the imagekeys!

Some name examples of languages:

* American English -> "simple-rpc-en_us.toml"
* Dutch -> "simple-rpc-nl_nl.toml"
|||

!!!danger
Warning: Leave the default config file in english, as the mod falls back to this file when a translated file cannot be found
!!!
