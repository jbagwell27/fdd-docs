### Bug Fixes

* Reworked the linked commands permissions to that it actually respects role/user permissions
* Fixed an issue with the account linking commands adding duplicate entries
* Fixed an NPE error when a tellraw command has no player linked to it
* Fixed messages only being relayed when a player is vanished, with vanish installed

### New Features

* Added a config option to allow changing how often the channel topic updates. Still limited to 5 minutes as the lowest
