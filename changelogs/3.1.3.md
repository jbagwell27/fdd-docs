### Bug Fixes

* Fixed Linked commands ignoring the 'useLinkedNames' config setting
* Added missing `Send Message In Threads` permissions to invite link and permission checker
* Channels set to "0" is no longer considered an error, but is logged as a warning
* Now forcefully logging discord disconnect errors, making it clearer why your bot refused to start.
* Change lower limit of topic updates to 6 minutes to prevent ratelimits
* Chat/Event/Console channel cache not reloading with `reloadcache` command
* Fix Join/Leave messages not working with Vanish
* Prevent discord messages from being processed before the bot is ready to do so

### Changes

* Improved the way we load the role cache, so it uses less resources on slower servers
* Swapped the position of the `allowedChannels` config option in the linked commands section
