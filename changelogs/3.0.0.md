### Changes

* The config structure has been cleaned up and re-organised. Config is now stored in `config/simple-discord-link/simple-discord-link.toml`
* Bot Token and Webhook URL fields are now ENCRYPTED. Encryption key is stored in `sdlinkstorage/key.enc`. Copy this file if you move the config to a new server!
* SQLite is no longer used for storing Whitelisted and Linked accounts. It's now stored in a JSON file, under `sdlinkstorage`
* You can now use channels and webhooks separately. If a channel is defined for something, but a webhook is not, the channel will be used instead.
* The Whitelist and Account Link systems have been removed and replaced by a new Access Control system.
* Linked Minecraft Commands can now be used outside the console channel
* TellRaw is now better supported, and will only relay messages from @a
* The `/sdreload` command has been removed. All important parts of the config auto-reloads. Things like channel ids, bot token, roles and webhooks require a server restart
* Text based commands `prefix command (~help, ~status, etc)` have been removed
* Removed Staff role config option. Command permissions are now handled by Discord command permissions
* IP Addresses now show as [REDACTED] in console relay
* Linked commands system has been fully redesigned to make it easier to use and configure
