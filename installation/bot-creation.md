## Creating the Bot

Go to [https://discord.com/developers](https://discord.com/developers)

Select "New Application" in the top right
<br>![](https://cdn.firstdark.dev/docs/sdlink-wiki/application1.png)

Give it a name, Agree to the Discord EULA, and click "Create"

:::note Naming Convention
Even though it will let you, Don't put "Discord" in the name of the application, or you're gonna have a bad time.
The Bot can't have "Discord" in the name, and it uses the Application name as the default bot name.

## Configuring the Bot (**Bot** Section)

### Build-A-Bot

In the **Build-A-Bot** Section click "Reset Token" to generate a private token. This is how SDLink knows which bot to send the commands to. Make a note of the token. once you leave this page, you won't be able to see it and will have to reset it again.

!!!danger DO NOT SHARE THE BOT TOKEN
It's important that you don't share this bot token with anyone. It is essentially the password for your bot. If the token is leaked anyone can use it for their own program and will have access to your Discord server.
This token will also be encrypted in the config file after you launch the server for the first time
!!!

### Authorization Flow
Click on the INSTALLATION Tab on the left hand menu.

From there on the `Installation` page, disable `User Install`, keep `Guild Install` checked, and set the `Install Link` to NONE.

Now go back to the BOT section.

Disable the "PUBLIC BOT" flag. This will ensure that only YOU can add the bot to a server

### Privileged Gateway Intents

Ensure all options in "Privileged Gateway Intents" are checked. These are needed for the bot to function.

For more details on what each permission does: see [SDLink Permissions Explained](./sdlink-perms.md)

Use the **GENERATED URL** at the bottom of the page to invite the bot to your discord channel

!!!info Pre-Configured URL
At first launch of the Minecraft server (after adding the bot token to the config) sdlink will generate an invite link and display it at the top of the console logs. This will have all the necessary permissions needed for the bot to function at full capacity
