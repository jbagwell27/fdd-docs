# SDLink Basic Mod Setup

This will go through the basics of getting the mod installed with bot status and chat features  

:::note
Before continuing, ensure you have followed the steps to Create and Invite the Discord Bot to your Discord server - [Discord Bot Setup](./bot-creation.md)
:::

## Installing the mod

SDLink requires CraterLib as a dependency. Download and transfer the mod files to the `mods/` folder

[Download from Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/craterlib) - [Download from Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/craterlib)

***

At first run an empty config file will be generated: `config/simple-discord-link/simple-discord-link.toml`  
See: [Empty Config](./empty-config.md)

## Configuration Settings

### Add the Bot Token

In the `[botConfig]` section, insert the bot token saved from [Discord Bot Setup](./bot-creation.md)

```json
[botConfig]
	botToken = "MTE2ODIyMDUyMDM3MDY3OTgzOA.Gjx_DN.1Xl0ZwC63e8sk3Iy9LWDhu2l9DD0oSIr39RcOI"
	#How often the Bot Status will update on Discord (in Seconds). Set to 0 to disable
	statusUpdateInterval = 30
```

This is the identifier for your bot. This token will be encrypted when your server starts up again.

&nbsp;

### Setting the Chat Channel

To get the chat channel ID, right-click on the channel you want chat and events to go and select "Copy Channel ID"<br>![](https://cdn.firstdark.dev/docs/sdlink-wiki/mod-config1.png)

In the `[channelsAndWebooks.channels]` section paste that ID in the `chatChannelID` field

```json
[channelsAndWebhooks.channels]
	#REQUIRED! The ID of the channel to post in and relay messages from. This is still needed, even in webhook mode
	chatChannelID = "1143258591260856360"
	#If this ID is set, event messages will be posted in this channel instead of the chat channel
	eventsChannelID = "0"
	#If this ID is set, console messages sent after the bot started will be relayed here
	consoleChannelID = "0"
```

This is the bare minimum needed to get the bot up and running with a status
