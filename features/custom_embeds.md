title: Custom Embeds

Simple Discord Link now allows you to customize the layout of embeds, used for various messages.

Custom Embeds are stored in `config/simple-discord-link/embeds` and use a JSON structure.

By default, the mod includes a single embed layout called `default.json`, which is used for all embeds.


The default embed looks like this:

```json
{
  "color": "#000000",
  "title": null,
  "url": null,
  "author": {
    "name": "%author%",
    "icon_url": "%avatar%",
    "url": null
  },
  "description": "%message_contents%",
  "thumbnail": null,
  "fields": null,
  "image": null,
  "timestamp": 0,
  "footer": null
}
```

      "value": "Field value"
    },
    {
      "name": "Field 2",
      "value": "You can use custom emojis <:Kekwlaugh:722088222766923847>. <:GangstaBlob:742256196295065661>",
      "inline": false
    },
    {
      "name": "Inline field",
      "value": "Fields can be inline",
      "inline": true
    },
    {
      "name": "Inline field",
      "value": "*Lorem ipsum*",
      "inline": true
    },
    {
      "name": "Inline field",
      "value": "value",
      "inline": true
    },
    {
      "name": "Another field",
      "value": "> Nope, didn't forget about this",
      "inline": false
    }
  ]
}
```

To ignore a value, simple set it to `null`.

### Adding your own embeds

In this example, we will create a custom embed to use, when the player dies.

To get started, create a new file called `death.json` in the `config/simple-discord-link/embeds` folder.

**Tip: Use this [Website](https://www.color-hex.com/) to find HEX color codes to use for `color`.**

We will then use the following layout:

```json
{
  "color": "#15695f",
  "title": "R.I.P ðŸ˜”",
  "url": null,
  "author": {
    "name": "%author%",
    "icon_url": "%avatar%",
    "url": null
  },
  "description": "%message_contents%",
  "thumbnail": {
    "url": "https://cdn.discordapp.com/embed/avatars/0.png"
  },
  "fields": null,
  "image": null,
  "timestamp": 0,
  "footer": {
    "text": "My Awesome Server",
    "icon_url": null
  }
}
```

In this example, we added a Title to the embed, added the server icon as a thumbnail to the embed, and added our server name in the footer.

To enable this embed, open up your config file and change

```json
#Control where DEATH messages are delivered
	[messageDestinations.death]
		#The Channel the message will be delivered to. Valid entries are CHAT, EVENT, CONSOLE
		channel = "EVENT"
		#Should the message be sent using EMBED style messages
		useEmbed = false
		#Embed Layout to use
		embedLayout = "default"
```

to

```json
#Control where DEATH messages are delivered
	[messageDestinations.death]
		#The Channel the message will be delivered to. Valid entries are CHAT, EVENT, CONSOLE
		channel = "EVENT"
		#Should the message be sent using EMBED style messages
		useEmbed = true
		#Embed Layout to use
		embedLayout = "death"
```

So to recap, change `embedLayout` to `death`.

The `embedLayout` uses the name of the json file, without the extension. So if your file is called `death.json`, your `embedLayout` will be `death`

### Embed Placeholders.

You can use the following placeholders inside embeds:

1) `%author%` -> The name of the Player/Server. For example: `HypherionSA`
2) `%avatar%` -> The player/server avatar link
3) `%message_contents%` -> The actual contents of the message
4) `%username%` -> The raw username of the player/server. For example, `hypherionsa` or `server`
5) `%player_avatar%` -> Get the Player avatar in server messages (Join/Leave, Death etc)
6) `%player_name%` -> Get the name of the player in server messages (Join/Leave, Death etc)
